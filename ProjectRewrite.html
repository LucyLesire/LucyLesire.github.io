											<h3>Project Rewrite</h3>
											<p>For the course Group Projects, me and 2 friends decided to create our own game. During the summer of 2022 we sat together and cooked up a prototype.
											After getting the green light from the teachers, we started production of our game, Project Rewrite.	
											<br>Project rewrite is a Horror game where you have to use time travel to your advantage to solve environmental puzzles and escape from the monster.</br></p>

											<h3>Learning</h3>
											<p>During this course I have learned how to work in Unreal Engine 5.
											<br>Furthermore I have also refound my passion for AI & AI programming.</br>

										<h3>Unreal Engine 5</h3>
										<p>We chose Unreal Engine 5 because of a few reasons, one of them is Lumen. Lumen allows us to create an amazing environment for a horror game. For me as an AI programmer it was also helpful to be able to use the Blackboard & Behavior tree that Unreal has built in.</p>
										<p>My role in the project fell mainly under AI & Gameplay programming: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Creating and implementing the Blackboard & Behavior tree</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the AI tasks (Patroling, Wandering, Chasing).</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the Perception Logic (Seeing & Hearing).</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the Monster Character & Spectral Monster Character</li>
											<li>Implemeting the Animations for the Monster</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing "The Claymore"</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the Throwing Mechanic</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the Inventory</li>
											<li>Implementing the UI & UI Logic</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>My experiences</h3>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 1: When starting our project, we chose to first create some base classes that functioned as blueprints for the rest of the game to come. I started to work on the healthcomponent and a simple gamemode, as my teammate took the movement and shooting on his plate. </p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 2: Next came the programming of the powerups, as besides shooting they were a fundamental part of the game! In order for me to create the powerups, I needed to write the logic for energy, dashing and shields.</p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 3: At this point in our game, we had gotten some of the art assets already, so we could change from a boring little box level to an actual pretty and funtional level. But this also meant that I needed to start working on the environmental effects of tile shaking and tile falling.</p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 4: With tile sinking in place, it was time to make our player killable, it wouldn't be much of a shooting game without it. One of the ways for the characters to die is by falling off the map, and as the map gets increasingly smaller, it also gets increasingly easier to fall off.</p>	
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 5: At the start of week 5, we were already quite deep into the project, and art came rolling in with it, including a new character and animations! It was my job to implement these and make sure that they blended nicely! On top of that we also added a HUD, so that the player can see their bullets, health, shield and energy!</p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 6: In this week, the production phase was coming to an end, so it was time for us to polish the gameloop and add much functionality for the game to be as fun as possible! I took care of adding 4 new weapons, the Corn Shotgun, Grape Minigun, the Coconut and the Lemon Bomb.</p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 7 & 8: With the production phase out of the way it was time for the final step, polishing. In the next two weeks I mainly took care of a lot of bugs that popped up during production, but I also refactored the HUD to be more visible and less overwhelming in information. I also added tons of sounds and particles to existing weapons and powerups!</p>
