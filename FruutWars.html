											<h3>Fruut Wars</h3>
											<p>For the course Game Projects, we were assigned a group of 2 programmers and 3 artists with the goal of making a vertical slice of a couch game.
											<br>We chose to make a Couch PVP shooter, in Unreal Engine 4.27, where you play as fruits and vegetables.</br>	
											<br>The goal of the game is to kill each other by firing fruits & vegetables, pick up better weapons and avoid falling in the water.</br></p>

											<h3>Learning</h3>
											<p>During this course I have learned how to use C++ with Unreal Engine.
											<br>Furthermore I have also learned how to work on a big project with a (relatively) big team.</br>
											<br>Finally I have learned how to create and setup a local multiplayer game in unreal.</br>

										<h3>Unreal Engine 4</h3>
										<p>We chose Unreal Engine 4 because of it's built in multiplayer features, particle system and blueprint functionality. We wrote most of our functionallity in C++ and some minor alterations in blueprints.</p>
										<p>My role in the project was very broad, due to the small team size, I had to take half of the work on me. My work contained the following: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Brainstorming and taking charge of the game design</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the health component.</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the energy, dash and shield logic.</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the Powerups.</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing the "Tile shaking" and "Tile sinking logic".</li>
											<li>Creating and implementing the Animation Blueprint logic.</li>
											<li>Creating and implementing "Dr Jalape√±o", "Lady Melon" & "Commisioner Potato"</li>
											<li>Writing and implementing "The Corn Minigun", "The Lemon Bomb" & "The Coconut Ball".</li>
											<li>Implementing the HUD".</li>

										<h3>My experiences</h3>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 1: When starting our project, we chose to first create some base classes that functioned as blueprints for the rest of the game to come. I started to work on the healthcomponent and a simple gamemode, as my teammate took the movement and shooting on his plate. </p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 2: Next came the programming of the powerups, as besides shooting they were a fundamental part of the game! In order for me to create the powerups, I needed to write the logic for energy, dashing and shields.</p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 3: At this point in our game, we had gotten some of the art assets already, so we could change from a boring little box level to an actual pretty and funtional level. But this also meant that I needed to start working on the environmental effects of tile shaking and tile falling.</p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 4: With tile sinking in place, it was time to make our player killable, it wouldn't be much of a shooting game without it. One of the ways for the characters to die is by falling off the map, and as the map gets increasingly smaller, it also gets increasingly easier to fall off.</p>	
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 5: At the start of week 5, we were already quite deep into the project, and art came rolling in with it, including a new character and animations! It was my job to implement these and make sure that they blended nicely! On top of that we also added a HUD, so that the player can see their bullets, health, shield and energy!</p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 6: In this week, the production phase was coming to an end, so it was time for us to polish the gameloop and add much functionality for the game to be as fun as possible! I took care of adding 4 new weapons, the Corn Shotgun, Grape Minigun, the Coconut and the Lemon Bomb.</p>
										</div>
										<div id="rcorners3">
											<p>Week 7 & 8: With the production phase out of the way it was time for the final step, polishing. In the next two weeks I mainly took care of a lot of bugs that popped up during production, but I also refactored the HUD to be more visible and less overwhelming in information. I also added tons of sounds and particles to existing weapons and powerups!</p>
